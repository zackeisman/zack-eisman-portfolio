# Zack Eisman Portfolio

## About
Hello! My name is Zack Eisman and I am data analyst looking to learn about and solve meaningful real-world problems. I am currently a senior studying Information Analysis at the Unviersity of Michigan School of Information. My degree is helping me develop hard skills such as programming and data analysis as well as soft skills such as teamwork and communication. I am passionate about business, where I am also pursuing a minor, and I want to use data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of business operations. In my free time, I enjoy exploring my passion for data analytics in sports, where I have experience working with the Michigan men's soccer team as well as creating interesting projects on a variety of sports such as soccer and ice hockey as the president of the Wolverine Sports Analytics club. I am eager to make relevant and interesting analysis on future projects while I am a student as well as after graduation.
