# Zack Eisman Portfolio

## About
Hello! My name is Zack Eisman and I am data analyst looking to learn about and solve meaningful real-world problems. I am currently a senior studying Information Analysis at the Unviersity of Michigan School of Information. My degree is helping me develop hard skills such as programming and data analysis as well as soft skills such as teamwork and communication. I am passionate about business, where I am also pursuing a minor, and I want to use data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of business operations. In my free time, I enjoy exploring my passion for data analytics in sports, where I have experience working with the Michigan men's soccer team as well as creating interesting projects on a variety of sports such as soccer and ice hockey as the president of the Wolverine Sports Analytics club. I am eager to make relevant and interesting analysis on future projects while I am a student as well as after graduation.

### Ann Arbor Water Project
**Code:** 

**Report:** [Ann Arbor Water Project Report.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16566296/SI.305.Final.Project.Report.pdf)

**Description:** This project analyzes 3 datasets on Ann Arbor, Michigan rainfall, Atlas-14 rainfall estimates, and Ann Arbor water main break history. The project involved reading in each database, clearning and preprocessing each, combining the data on similar columns, and performing exploratory data analysis to answer the following 3 research questions: 

1) Are the Atlas-14 estimates for Ann Arbor accurate?

2) How does change in rainfall over consistent time periods relate to the frequency of water main breaks?

3) Are water mains in certain Ann Arbor regions breaking more frequently than others?

**Skills:** data cleaning, data exploration, data analysis, database merging, data visualization

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Michigan Men's Soccer Team Project
**Code:** 

**Report:** 

**Description:** This project involved scouting opponents using data for the Michigan Men's Soccer Team and Assitant Coach Jhojan Obando. Prior to each match, I analyzed Wyscout scouting reports for each of Michigan's opponent's 4 most recent games. Using that data, I compiled shorter reports on each opponent's strengths, weaknesses, and general observations that were sent to the Michigan coaching staff for pre-match preperation. After the conclusion of each match, I would analyze the Wyscout report to determine if Michigan was able to successfully gain competitive advantages by nullifying strengths and attacking weaknesses. Additionally, feedback from the coaching staff was used to determine the success of my analysis.

**Skills:** data analysis, data synthesis, data visualization

**Technology:**  Wyscout, Python, pandas, seaborn
