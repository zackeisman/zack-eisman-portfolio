## About
Hello! My name is Zack Eisman and I am data analyst looking to learn about and solve meaningful real-world problems. I am currently a senior studying Information Analysis at the Unviersity of Michigan School of Information. My degree is helping me develop hard skills such as programming and data analysis as well as soft skills such as teamwork and communication. I am passionate about business, where I am also pursuing a minor, and I want to use data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of business operations. In my free time, I enjoy exploring my passion for data analytics in sports, where I have experience working with the Michigan men's soccer team as well as creating interesting projects on a variety of sports such as soccer and ice hockey as the president of the Wolverine Sports Analytics club. I am eager to make relevant and interesting analysis on future projects while I am a student as well as after graduation.

## Academic Projects
In this section, I will list and briefly describe data analytics projects that I have completed for classes.

### Overfishing Crisis Project

**Report:** [SI 330 Final Project](overfishing-crisis-project/SI_330_Final_Project_Phase_3.pdf)

**Description:** The project focuses on the global overfishing problem and how data can be used to help. 3 different datasets were used, providing helpful information on fishing statistics by country such as aquaculture and capture fishery production, fish consumption, sustainable fish stocks, country populations across time, and general country information. The datasets were merged together to better answer how certain economical, socail, and geographical factors can predict a country's impact on overfishing and how the United States specifically compares to similar countries around the world.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data exploration, data analysis, database merging, data visualization

**Technology:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, regex

### FIFA Wonderkids Project
**Code:** [R Code](fifa-wonderkids-project/Appendices.Rmd)

**Report:** [Stats 401 Final Project](fifa-wonderkids-project/Stats401FinalProjectPDF.pdf)

**Report Appendices:** [Stats 401 Final Project Appendices](fifa-wonderkids-project/Appendices.pdf)

**Description:** This project uses data from the FIFA 2022 video game to predict which soccer players make for the best acquisitions in the game's career mode. Initially, a simple linear model was created to predicted a player's potential overall given other parameters such as player overall, age, transfer value, and league. However, the model was then adjusted to pass the required statistical assumptions of constant variance and better predict potential overall. 

**Skills:** data cleaning, data exploration, data analysis, data visualization, linear regression

**Technology:** R, ggplot

### Ann Arbor Water Project

**Report:** [SI 305 Final Project Report](ann-arbor-water-project/SI_305_Final_Project_Report.pdf)

**Description:** This project analyzes 3 datasets on Ann Arbor, Michigan rainfall, Atlas-14 rainfall estimates, and Ann Arbor water main break history. The project involved reading in each database, clearning and preprocessing each, combining the data on similar columns, and performing exploratory data analysis to answer the following 3 research questions: 

1) Are the Atlas-14 estimates for Ann Arbor accurate?

2) How does change in rainfall over consistent time periods relate to the frequency of water main breaks?

3) Are water mains in certain Ann Arbor regions breaking more frequently than others?

**Skills:** data cleaning, data exploration, data analysis, database merging, data visualization

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Michigan Men's Soccer Team Project
**Code:** [SI 311 Soccer Project Code](michigan-mens-soccer-project/SI_311_Soccer_Project_Poster_Visual_2.ipynb)

**Report:** [SI 311 Soccer Projece Final Poster](michigan-mens-soccer-project/SI_311_Soccer_Project_Poster.pdf)

**Description:** This project involved scouting opponents using data for the Michigan Men's Soccer Team and Assitant Coach Jhojan Obando. Prior to each match, I analyzed Wyscout scouting reports for each of Michigan's opponent's 4 most recent games. Using that data, I compiled shorter reports on each opponent's strengths, weaknesses, and general observations that were sent to the Michigan coaching staff for pre-match preperation. After the conclusion of each match, I would analyze the Wyscout report to determine if Michigan was able to successfully gain competitive advantages by nullifying strengths and attacking weaknesses. Additionally, feedback from the coaching staff was used to determine the success of my analysis.

**Skills:** data analysis, data synthesis, data visualization

**Technology:**  Wyscout, Python, pandas, seaborn

## Personal Projects
In this section, I will list and briefly describe data analytics projects that I have completed in my personal time related to clubs and personal interests.

### Wolverine Sports Analytics Tutorials
**Code:** [Folder with All WSA Tutorials](wolverine-sports-analytics-tutorials)

**Description:** As the at-the-time Education Officer, my most significant responsibility was creating a tutorial process that would onboard all new Wolverine Sports Analytics club members to the technology stack that we most commonly use. These tutorials follow through an example project that is similar to what many of the club members are expected to produce themselves. The tutorials cover a large variety of data analytics topics, starting with an elementary overview of Python Basics and progressing to cover web scraping with BeautifulSoup, data management with SQL, data manipulation with Pandas, data visualization with Matplotlib, regression with Scikit-Learn, and machine learning with Tensorflow.

**Skills:** data analytics, web scraping, data management, data cleaning, data manipulation, data merging, data visualization, linear regression, machine learning

**Technology:** Python, BeautifulSoup, SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodel API, Tensorflow, Seaborn

### Premier League Transfer Market Project
**Web Scraping Code:** [Premier League Scraping Code](premier-league-transfer-market-project/Soccer-Project-Revamp-Scraping.ipynb)

**Analysis Code:** [Premier League Analysis Code](premier-league-transfer-market-project/Soccer-Project-Revamp.ipynb)

**Report:** [Premier League Project Final Presentation](premier-league-transfer-market-project/WSA_Soccer_Project_Revamp_Final_Presentation.pdf)

**Description:** For this Wolverine Sports Analytics project, I was a Project Lead. Our goal was to take various English Premier League statistics from websites such as fbreference.com and use them to determine which Premier League transfers were the most effective for their cost. Additionally, the project explored overall team success based on the same statistics. We aggregated players by team to create a predicted Premier League table as well as determined which teams found the best value in the transfer market and which clubs relied the most on incoming players. By myself, I revamped the project a year after its initial completion to include the previous year's statistics and clean much of the data that was missing or misleading.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data exploration, data analysis, data visualization

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, BeautifulSoup, SQL

### NCAA Hockey Cards Project
**Code:** [Hockey Project Code](ncaa-hockey-cards-project/overallScore.py)

**Report:** [Hockey Project Final Presentation](ncaa-hockey-cards-project/Hockey-Presentation-Final-Slides.pdf)

**Description:** This project was completed during the Fall 2023 semester for the Wolverine Sports Analytics club. The project used USHL data provided by Michigan Men's Ice Hockey Director of Analysis Anthony Ciatti. Using the data, we created a model that compares USHL players to others of the same position to create a "score" in 4 different categories: prodiction, offense, defense, and transition. These scores were then aggregated to compute an overall score for each player. These scores were passed along to Ciatti who used them for scouting purposes.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data exploration, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning

**Technology:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, xgboost, seaborn, scikit-learn, SQL

### Baseball Stolen Base Analysis Project
**Code:** [SMT Data Challenge Code](baseball-stolen-base-analysis-project/code)

**Report:** [SMT Data Challenge Final Report](baseball-stolen-base-analysis-project/SMT-Data-Challenge-Report.pdf)

**Description:** This project was completed as an entry in the 2023 SMT Data Challenge. The project used databases containing information on baseball games including ball position, fielder position, and game occurances. My team analyzed stolen base decisions and whether or not it is more effective for a catcher to focus on pop time or throw speed in regards to throwing a runner out at second base. The project also explores leadoff distance for the runner and asks whether or not there is a sweet spot distance for the runner.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data exploration, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning

**Technology:** R, ggplot, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
